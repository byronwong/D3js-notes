This is a basic starter-kit that runs a simple express server. Ideally for sandbox and very early prototypes.

## Getting started
- `npm i`
- `npm start` - NOTE: we are using `nodemon` to reset the serve on change.
- `npm-run-all --parallel task1 task2` - runs tasks in parallel
- `-s ` - run in silent mode
- Add your `.env file`

## Things to do
- remove nodemon and webpack hot loader and opn modules now refresh page
- setup sass compiling

## What's in this project 
> Note: Using webpack dev server for now, however express js is still here for further development with webpack-dev-middleware. Change NPM start script!
